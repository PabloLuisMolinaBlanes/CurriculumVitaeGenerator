You will note there are three sample files. These are:

 - A sample CSS: Which just styles the project, can be changed.
 
 - A sample txt file: For the program to acquire data from.
 
 - A html file: The generated file by the program.
 
 The most important smaple file is the txt file, which is thought to dynamically generate CVs divided into modifiable sections.
 There are some sections with special meaning. These are:
 
  - << Experiencia: To be formatted like this Company-Starting Year-Ending Year-Position, each in a different line. Supports various rows
  in the same section
  - << Educacion: Formatted the same as Experiencia.
  - << Imagen: Only the name of the picture file is to be inputted, along with the filetype. An example is "roca.jpg", not "roca".
  Sections are named like this "<< Educacion".
  Paragraphs start after the beginning of a section and end for that section when another is started. It does not support multiple sections in a single line.
